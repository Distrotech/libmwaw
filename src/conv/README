a directory which contains a list of small convertors:

- mwaw2html: convert a file ( accepted by libmwaw ) in html,
   keeping most of the character and paragraph properties and the
   table, but not the pictures, ...
- mwaw2text: convert a file ( accepted by libmwaw ) in text,
   keeping only the different characters

- mwaw2raw: a utility which outputs the list of instructions sent by
   libmwaw, can be used for debugging, ...

Note: most of these convertors are a simple copy of libwpd convertors,
   except mwaw2html which has been a little enhanced...
