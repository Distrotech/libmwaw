a directory which contains a list of small convertors:

- mwaw2html: convert a file ( accepted by libmwaw ) in html,
   keeping most of the character and paragraph properties and the
   table, but not the pictures, ...
- mwaw2text: convert a file ( accepted by libmwaw ) in text,
   keeping only the different characters

- mwaw2csv: convert the main spreadsheet spreadsheet content in csv, ...
- mwaw2raw: a utility which outputs the list of instructions sent by
   libmwaw, can be used for debugging, ...
- mwaw2svg: convert a graphic in svg. As not graphic exported are currently
   implemented in libmwaw, actually does nothing :-~

Note: most of these convertors called only the librevenge associated
   generators...
