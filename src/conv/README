a directory which contains a list of small convertors:

- mwaw2html: convert a file ( accepted by libmwaw ) in html,
   keeping most of the character and paragraph properties and the table,
   but not the pictures, ...
- mwaw2text: convert a file ( accepted by libmwaw ) in text,
   keeping only the different characters
- mwaw2raw: a utility which outputs the list of instructions sent by libmwaw,
   can be used for debugging, ...

Notes: most of this convertors are a simple copy of libwpd convertors, except
   mwaw2html which has been a little enhanced...
