A repository which contains various small tools; ok, in fact, only two tools :-)

- mwawFile:
   a small tool which tries to find the type of a file first by looking to the finder information,
   then in the ressource fork for strings -16396, -16397 : application missing name or
   missing message and finally looking for a signature in the application datafork...

   Note: it first uses attributes to find finder information and resource data ; if it finds
	none, it looks for a file ._filename or __MACOSX/._filename

- mwawZip:
   a small tool which tries to zip a file and it attributes to obtain a file which can be used
   as input of mwaw2odt, mwaw2html, ... : an equivalent of the Finder compress function.

   More precisely, when zipping a file <<filename>>, it includes the file datafork and
   looks for attributes ( either using getxattr or in a file ._filename or __MACOSX/._filename )
   if so, it includes them in the result file.

   Note:
	- in order to avoid mistakes, it stops if the resulting zip file already exists.
	- only one file can be zipped, ... .
