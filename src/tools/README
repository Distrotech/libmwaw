A repository which contains various small tools; ok, in fact, only two
tools :-)

- mwawFile:
   a small tool which tries to find the type of a file first by
   looking to the finder information, then in the ressource fork for
   strings -16396, -16397 : application missing name or missing
   message and finally looking for a signature in the application
   datafork...

   Note: it first uses attributes to find finder information and
     resource data ; if it finds none, it looks for a file ._filename
     or __MACOSX/._filename ; if not, it looks for a file FINDER.DAT
     and a RESOURCE.FRK directory.

- mwawZip:
   a small tool which tries to zip a file and it attributes to obtain
   a file which can be used as input of mwaw2odf, mwaw2html, ... : an
   equivalent of the Finder compress function.

   More precisely, when zipping a file <<filename>>, it includes the
   file datafork and looks for attributes ( either using
   FINDER.DAT/RESOURCE.FRK or getxattr or in a file ._filename or
   __MACOSX/._filename ). If so, it includes them in the result file.

   Notes:
	- in order to avoid mistakes, it stops if the resulting zip
	file already exists.
	- only one file can be zipped, ... .
